# Looming Stimulator

Looming visual stimuli are used in behavioral research to trigger rapid innate defensive response of rodents, which is called looming-evoked defensive response. This stimulator is based on a typical protocol shared by two articles<sup>[1](#1),[2](#2)</sup>, that a black disc expands from a diameter of 2° of visual angle to 20° in 250ms and remains for another 250ms for a single stimulus, and then repeat several times with 500ms pauses<sup>[1](#1)</sup>.

#### Requirements
1. A secondary monitor is required to project stimuli.
2. python3.x

#### Usage:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py
```
